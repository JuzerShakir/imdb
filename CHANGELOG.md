## [v0.0.10](https://github.com/JuzerShakir/imdb/tree/v0.0.10) (2023-10-06)

A new **MUST UPDATE** patch release! ðŸŽ‰

This version includes following changes:

- **Major Bug fix** - If a `game` media-type instance has been initialized then the `duration` method will not work for other media-type instances that are created after.
  - To solve the above issue, we created a different module named `non_interactive` which will `prepend` in all modules under `titles\` directory except the `VideoGame` module.
  - Shift the `duration` method from `IMDb::Title` class to `NonInteractive` module.
- Remove `split_these` & `inspect_this` methods from `IMDb::Title` class
- Rename `UnSupportedTypeError` to `UnSupportedMediaType`.
- Update few methods to return an array type else `nil` if it doesn't exist.
- Update comments for better documentation.
- Add `.reek.yml` file to ignore smell detectors in edge cases.
